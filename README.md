:snowflake: This is _one of several other_ challenge projects proposed by __Frontend Mentor__.

_You know, I enjoyed working on this project. I was able to work more on my skills in `CSS Grid`._

:books: Throughout the development of the project I was very concerned with the _semantics_ of HTML.

:sunflower: As usual, I don't have high knowledge of `SCSS`, which is a sin on my part, as this tool is exceptional and I use it quite often myself. Especially on a relatively large project (compared to all the others I've done) like this one. Using this preprocessor came in very handy.

:triangular_ruler: __The project is fully responsive.__

:pencil: I designed the entire interface thinking about how it would look on a cell phone whose horizontal resolution would be 320px (Mobile first). Then I adjusted along the standard breakpoints.
